# Chess Game Sound Files

This directory contains the sound effects for the chess game.

## Required Sound Files

The following sound files are needed for the game to work properly:

### Move Sounds
- `move.mp3` - Sound played when a piece is moved
- `move.ogg` - OGG format for better browser compatibility

### Capture Sounds
- `capture.mp3` - Sound played when a piece is captured
- `capture.ogg` - OGG format for better browser compatibility

### Connection Sounds
- `connection-lost.mp3` - Sound played when connection to server is lost
- `connection-lost.ogg` - OGG format for better browser compatibility

- `reconnected.mp3` - Sound played when connection to server is restored
- `reconnected.ogg` - OGG format for better browser compatibility

## Audio Settings

All sounds are played at 30% volume (0.3) by default.

## Browser Compatibility

The game supports both MP3 and OGG formats for maximum browser compatibility. Modern browsers will automatically select the best format available.

## Note

If you don't have these sound files, you can:
1. Download free chess sound effects from online resources
2. Record your own sounds
3. Use placeholder sounds from other chess games

The game will still function without sound files, but no audio will be played.
